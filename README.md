## What is Bioinformatics?

Except from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21136/

    A genome sequence is not an end in itself. A major challenge still has to be met in understanding what the genome contains and how the genome functions. The former is addressed by a combination of computer analysis and experimentation, with the primary aim of locating the genes and their control regions. The first part of this chapter is devoted to these methods. The second question - understanding how the genome functions - is, to a certain extent, merely a different way of stating the objectives of molecular biology over the last 30 years. The difference is that in the past attention has been directed at the expression pathways for individual genes, with groups of genes being considered only when the expression of one gene is linked to that of another. Now the question has become more general and relates to the expression of the genome as a whole. The techniques used to address this topic will be covered in the latter parts of this chapter.
    
    Once a DNA sequence has been obtained, whether it is the sequence of a single cloned fragment or of an entire chromosome, then various methods can be employed to locate the genes that are present. These methods can be divided into those that involve simply inspecting the sequence, by eye or more frequently by computer, to look for the special sequence features associated with genes, and those methods that locate genes by experimental analysis of the DNA sequence. The computer methods form part of the methodology called bioinformaticsâ€¦
